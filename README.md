🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things!  
Luckily the curriculum is quite open.  
Why not take a look at the great [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course?

👨‍🏫 I'm a course assistant on some programming courses!  
Right now I'm helping on the following courses:  
\- [Introduction to Programming](https://programming-22.mooc.fi/)  
\- [Advanced Course in Programming](https://programming-22.mooc.fi/)  
The best part is that they're also open for anyone & [open source](https://github.com/rage/programming-22)!  
It's the perfect resource to start learning programming & Python.
